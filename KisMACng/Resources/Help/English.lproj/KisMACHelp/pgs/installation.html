            The KisMAC installer can be used to either install or remove KisMAC.<BR>
            Removing KisMAC is covered in another chapter.
        </FONT><BR><BR>
    <LI>If you have previously installed the Sourceforge Wireless Driver for a third party wireless card, 
        the KisMAC installer will now ask whether you want to install a patch for this driver.  If you do 
        not have this driver installed, this dialog will be skipped and you can proceed with the next step.<BR>
        <BR>
        The Sourceforge Wireless Driver has a bug, which disallows KisMAC to unload and reload the driver 
        at run-time.  If you choose to patch it, the Installer will also install a utility, which allows 
        you to change the MAC address of your Prism II or Orinoco card.<BR>
        <BR>
        Installing a new driver is always a bit risky. If there should be problems, you can always boot
        your system by holding the SHIFT key at startup and remove KisMAC.<BR>
        <BR>
        Please remember to reinstall KisMAC, if you install the Sourceforge Wireless Drivers later on.<BR><BR>
    <LI>Next will be the General Public License agreement, after reading the license, click go again.<BR><BR>
    <LI>The installer will now ask for your admin password.  You must be an admin user to install KisMAC.<BR>
        <IMG SRC="../gfx/authenticator.png" HEIGHT="200" WIDTH="317" BORDER="0"><BR><BR>
    <LI>Once you click okay in the password dialogue, the installer will immediately search for older versions
        of KisMAC and remove any it finds before proceeding.  It will then place the KisMAC application in your
        Applications folder along with the KisMAC Driver Tool.  The installer also places alternative wireless
        card drivers used by KisMAC in the required place on your System drive.  (A complete list of files
        installed can be found at the end of this chapter)<BR><BR>
    <LI>You are now ready to begin using KisMAC.  Start by double clicking the KisMAC icon in the Finder. 
        Note: Sometimes it takes a minute until the Finder refreshes the Application Folder.<BR><BR>
