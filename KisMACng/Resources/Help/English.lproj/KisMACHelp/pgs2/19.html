* in active mode the WiFi device sends out probe request and waits for answers. The data obtained from these answers is shown.
</TD><TD>
* When you use KisMAC passively the WiFi device is switched into "monitor mode". It waits silently for any valid packets and this data is used to derive the network structure.

- probe request can be easily detected
</TD><TD>
+ passive sniffers cannot be detected
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
- the sniffer cannot see raw data, therefore PCAP? logging and cracking will not work
</TD><TD>
+ only passive devices can perform WEP cracking and logging of data
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
- the active component of KisMAC cannot detect WPA? networks (they are shown as WEPed?)
</TD><TD>
+ WPA? and LEAP? detection is possible
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
- active programs cannot see hidden networks (per definition)
</TD><TD>
+ KisMAC can find and reveal cloaked networks if used in monitor mode
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
+ you will not loose your WiFi connectivity (it will only become slower because of all the probing)
</TD><TD>
- KisMAC will need to load a replacement for your normal driver in order to switch the device into monitor mode. Connectivity will be lost
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
+ Airport Extreme? is supported
</TD><TD>
- Airport Extreme? devices will not work in passive mode
