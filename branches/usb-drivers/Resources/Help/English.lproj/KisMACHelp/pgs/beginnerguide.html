<p><font face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial" size="2">Before you can begin
using KisMAC you must open the preferences and select a driver to use for
your specific wireless card.</font></p>

<p></p>
<ol>
  <li>Open the preferences from the KisMAC menu and click on the Driver
    icon.<br>
    <img src="../gfx/driverprefs.png" alt="Driver Preference Pane" border="0"
    height="423" width="350"><br>
    <font face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial" size="1"> Note: Each of these
    drivers will prevent you from using your wireless<br>
    card to access networks while KisMAC is running, however KisMAC<br>
    must use one of these drivers to scan for networks.  For more
    information<br>
    about driver capabilities, see the expanded driver section later in this
    manual. </font><br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>There are six different drivers to choose from.
    <ol>
      <li>The first is the Apple Airport or Airport Extreme card, which
        operates in active mode. This means that you can still use your
        wireless card, but you will not have full functionality when using
        KisMAC. This is the driver you want to use if you have an Apple
        branded Airport card and all you want to do is search for networks.
        If you have a Apple Airport, or an Apple Airport extreme card and
        would like to operate it in active mode, choose this driver. If you
        just want to simply wardrive, choose this driver - it will not see
        closed networks, but closed networks are nearly always WEP or WPAed,
        which are no use to you. You can't crack networks with this
      driver.</li>
      <li>The second driver is for the Apple AirPort Extreme card in passive
        mode. This has recently been reverse-engineered and now works in
        passive mode.</li>
      <li>The second driver is for the Apple Airport card, passive mode. You
        will not be able to access any networks while in passive mode, but
        you will have expanded capabilities in KisMAC. This driver does not
        work with Airport Extreme cards (use the previous one). If you have
        an Apple Airport card, and you want to operate it in passive mode,
        choose this driver.</li>
      <li>The third driver is for Prism2/Orinoco/Hermes cards. It operates
        only in passive mode. If you have a Prism2, an Orinoco, or a Hermes
        card, choose this driver.</li>
      <li>The fourth driver is for Cisco Aironet cards. It operates only in
        passive mode. If you have a Cisco Aironet card, choose this
      driver.</li>
      <li>The fifth driver is for if you have a USB wireless adapter with a
        Prism2 chipset. It operates only in passive mode. If you have a USB
        device with a Prism2 chipset, choose this driver.</li>
      <li>The sixth driver is for Atheros based cards. It operates only in
        passive mode. If you have a Atheros based card, choose this
      driver.</li>
    </ol>
   <b> Note:</b> if you do not know which driver to use, you can refer to the table
    of common card brands at the end of this chapter. Updates to KisMAC are
    released more frequently than updates to the documentation, if this
    information is not up to date, please submit a new version.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>KisMac also allows permanently enabling airport extreme to operate in
    passive mode. To enable this feature check the box at the bottom of the
    window (requires reboot).<b> Note:</b> If enabled, your wireless card can be used
    by other applications however, this can cause your data to be captured in
    the dump and result in confusion.
  </li>
    <br>
  <li>Your password will be asked for each time you start KisMAC because the
    drivers must be loaded and unloaded. If you would like KisMAC to load the
    drivers without asking for your password, check the Make scripts SUID
    root checkbox. You can also use the KisMAC Driver Tool, installed with
    KisMAC, to start or stop the drivers.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial" size="2">After selecting a driver,
you can now use KisMAC to scan for networks by clicking on the scan button in
the main window.  It is recommended however, that you go through all of the
preferences in order to get the best KisMAC experience.</font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial" size="2">Scanning
Preferences</font></p>

<p></p>
<ol>
  <li>WI-FI networks have 11 possible channels (14 non-us, 13 in Europe). A
    typical access point will be available on 3 channels a time, since these
    channels actually overlap. In order to detect all networks, KisMAC will
    make the wireless card "hop" between all selected channels. The frequency
    field changes how often KisMAC changes channels. Before you select
    channel 12-14 please make sure your card can use this channels, otherwise
    strange side effects might occur, such as phantom base stations being
    detected, inability to detect anything else, or simply just nothing - the
    wireless card may shut down.<br>
    <img src="../gfx/scanningprefs.png" alt="Scanning Preference Pane"
    border="0" height="205" width="309"><br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Once you find a network that you want to monitor, it is recommended
    that you only select the channel the network uses in order to capture
    more data from that network.  Note:  Cisco Aironet cards perform hopping
    internally and the settings will be disabled when using one of these
    cards.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>The dump filter settings will tell KisMAC to create a PCAP file with
    the following filtering options:
    <ol>
      <li>The default setting is no dumping, KisMAC simply discards the
      data.</li>
      <li>Keep everything - All intercepted traffic is written to the log
        file.</li>
      <li>Data only - Only packets containing data are written to the log
        file; empty, "I'm here," traffic is ignored, but any packets with
        weak initialization vectors (IVs) will be logged.</li>
      <li>Weak frames only - only packets with weak initialization vectors
        will be written to the log file.</li>
    </ol>
    <b>Note:</b> Dumping traffic is only useful if you want to make the
    captured data available for third party tools, such as ethereal, dsniff
    or ettercap. You probably don't need this unless you want to see what the
    data was or monitor it. You also don't need to use any of these features
    to crack WEP. Weak (IVs) are automatically captured and can be saved in a 
    KisMAC save file if needed.</li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial" size="2">Sound
Preferences</font></p>

<p></p>
<ol>
  <li>KisMAC can be set to play different sounds when different types of
    networks have been detected. This can be helpful for wardriving when you
    might not be able to look at the computer screen.
    <ol>
      <li>WEP enabled network: play the selected sound when an encrypted
        network is detected.</li>
      <li>WEP disabled network: play this sound when an open network is
        detected.</li>
      <li>Play every x packets:  This option is useful when to gathering data
        to attempt to crack a network. Alerts you when a certain amount of
        data has been collected.  See the cracking chapter later in this
        manual.</li>
      <li>Optionally, KisMAC can speak the names (SSID) of detected networks,
        also useful while wardriving.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial" size="2">These are the basic
preferences that you need to know in order to get started with KisMAC. There
are many more advanced features that are covered in depth in their own
chapters of the manual.</font></p>
